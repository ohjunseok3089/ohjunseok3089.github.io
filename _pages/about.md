# Welcome to My Personal Webpage

## About Me

### Graduate-level research enthusiast working on Generative AI and Machine Learning systems for the AIOps team at Hewlett Packard Enterprise.

#### Background
I am an MS candidate from the University of Pennsylvania pursuing Data Science, and I received my Bachelor's Degree from Purdue University. I am currently working full-time at Hewlett Packard Enterprise in the AIOps team, focusing on Generative AI, Data Science, Multimodal and Agent AI among other areas. Previously, I interned at Stanford University Cardiovascular Institute (Summer 2024, 2023, 2022) and Purdue University Mechanical Engineering (2022–23) as a student research assistant, as well as at Hewlett Packard Enterprise (2023) and Wittgen Biotechnology (2022) as a data science research intern.

#### My research focuses on:
- Computer Vision and Large Language Models
- Efficient AI/ML Models and Usage
- Human-Computer Interaction

I primarily aim to contribute to improving interactions between humans and computer/robot systems
